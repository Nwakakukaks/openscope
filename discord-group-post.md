Hey everyone! 👋

## Quick Intro

I'm super excited to share what I've been building - **OpenScope**! It's a visual plugin builder for Daydream Scope that lets you create video processing pipelines without writing any code.

## What It Does

Basically, you drag nodes onto a canvas, connect them together, tweak some sliders, and boom - you've got a custom video processor ready to export as a plugin!

Right now it has:
- ✨ Pre-processors: Segmentation, Depth Estimation
- 🎨 Post-processors: Kaleido, VHS/Retro CRT
- 🤖 AI Processor (Beta): Let AI generate custom processor code for you
- 📦 One-click plugin export

## Why I Built It

I kept wanting to create video effects but didn't want to deal with Python code every time. So I thought - what if there was a visual way to build these pipelines? And OpenScope was born!

## What's Coming Next

- More processors (background removal, upscaling, color grading, etc.)
- Better AI assistance
- Community sharing features

## Let's Connect!

Would love to get your thoughts and feedback! What video effects would you want to create? Any features that would make this more useful for you?

Thanks to the Daydream AI Video Program Cohort 2 for the inspiration! This community is awesome. 🙏

Check it out and let me know what you think! 🎬
