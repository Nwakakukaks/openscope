# Introducing OpenScope: Visual Plugin Builder for Daydream Scope

Hello everyone!

## A Quick Introduction

I'm excited to share OpenScope with the community - a visual node-based plugin builder for Daydream Scope that I've been working on.

## Why I Built OpenScope

I created OpenScope because I wanted to make video AI processing more accessible. Writing Python code for video effects can be intimidating for many creators. By providing a visual node-based interface, users can now compose processors by simply dragging and connecting nodes - no coding required.

## What OpenScope Currently Does

OpenScope allows you to:

- **Build pipelines visually** - Drag and drop nodes to create video processing pipelines
- **Choose pre-processors** - Segmentation and Depth Estimation (with more coming)
- **Apply post-processors** - Kaleido and VHS/Retro CRT effects
- **Generate custom processors with AI** - Use the Beta AI feature to generate processor code
- **Export as plugins** - One-click export to create Daydream-compatible plugin ZIPs
- **See live code** - Toggle to view reactive Python code that updates as you adjust parameters

## Future Plans

Looking ahead, I plan to:

- Expand the processor library with more pre and post-processors
- Add more AI-assisted generation features
- Enable community-built processor sharing
- Improve real-time preview capabilities

## Thank You

A huge thank you to the **Daydream AI Video Program Cohort 2** for the inspiration and support. This program helped me understand what's possible with video AI and motivated me to build OpenScope.

## I'd Love Your Feedback

This is just the beginning, and I'd love to hear from you! If you try OpenScope, let me know:

- What processors would you like to see next?
- How can we make the visual builder more intuitive?
- What features would help you create better video effects?

Feel free to share your thoughts, report issues, or contribute on GitHub. Every piece of feedback helps shape OpenScope into a better tool for everyone.

Looking forward to seeing what you create!
